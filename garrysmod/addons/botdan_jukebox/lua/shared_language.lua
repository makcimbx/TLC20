	Please note that I am currently working on language support.
	This here is currently unfinished but does work.
	PROGRESS:
	- ALL SONGS:
		- Normal User 		✔
		- Admin 			✖
	- QUEUE:
		- Normal User 		✔
		- Admin 			✖
	- OPTIONS
		- Normal User		✔
		- Admin 			✔
	- ADD A SONG - MANUAL
		- Normal User		✔
		- Admin				✔
	- ADD A SONG - SEARCH
		- Normal User		✔
		- Admin 			✔
	- ADMIN TABS			✖
	
	Also note that more phrases are to be added soon for Admin support.
	This means this file will change soon - don't get too confortable with it.
	I also recommend reading the README - Languages.txt file.

-- CREATING A LANGUAGE
-- To create a new language, copy the whole list below and paste it in the space under.
-- You can then rename the language by changing "English" to "YOUR LANGUAGE NAME"
-- Make sure to not remove any = or , because it can cause errors.

-- SPECIAL CHARACTERS
-- Make sure to keep the same amount of special characters in each phrase.
-- If a phrase has 2 %s, make sure to keep 2 %s.
-- %s	Replced by a variable, such as song name or artist
-- \n	Creates a new line
