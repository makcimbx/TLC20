## Introduction

Conquest System is a lightweight addon to add conquest features in **any** gamemode.

Capture points are set up by admins and any team can capture them by being in the area for at least 5 seconds (see config). If a different team player enters the zone while contesting it, then the point is reset until only one team remains.

The goal of this system is to allow easy customization of the entire interface **(for non developers)** and to provide a decent API for developers to integrate with.

## Features
- Simple to use admin interface to manage capture points.
- DarkRP integration.
- Developer hooks.
- Lightweight non-conflicting addon.
- Highly configurable.
- (planned) Simple HUD editor to configure the look and feel of the system.

## Setting up
Setting points up:


1. As an admin, open the Conquest System GUI using `ConquestSystem_Open` in the console.
1. Move to the location you want to create the capture point at.
1. Navigate to the `Create` interface through the button on the Conquest System GUI.
1. Type in the credentials and hit accept, your capture point is now in the system.


## Config

All of the configuration is inside the `ConquestSystem/lua/ConquestSystem/sh_config.lua`. The description of the config format is held in the same file as comments.


## Developer API

Hooks are available for use in development, listed as:


1. `ConquestSystem_PointCaptured`, Args = TeamName
1. `ConquestSystem_CapturedPointTick`, Args = TeamName, this hook is called once per second.
1. `ConquestSystem_PointLost`, Args = TeamName


## Commands
"ConquestSystem_Open": Opens the Conquest System GUI.
