	Please, PLEASE don't leak my script.
	I worked VERY hard on Unisec. If you know someone who needs it but can't afford it, please just ask me and we can work out a deal like adults.
	I'm just trying to make some money to get myself through college.
	If you do leak this script, you will be banned from ScriptFodder. I will know that it was you. Scriptfodder has tools for that.
