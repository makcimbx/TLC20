##### This addon can be installed via the [Steam Workshop for Garry's Mod](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=109643223) - I do not recommend manually installing this addon via git.

###### Features:

* Multiple different font sizes and colours 
* Heavily optimised
  * Full scale testing on a highly popular RP server 
  * Draw distance optimisations 
  * Minimal FPS hit
* Option to make screens permanent - perfect for welcome messages or rules 
  * Hold C for context menu, right click on the textscreen, and make the text screen permanent! (only works for admins)
